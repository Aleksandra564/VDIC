a) Which objects in the diagram instantiate which?
random_test instantiates env
env instantiates random_tester, uvm_tlm_fifo fifo, driver, coverage, scoreboard, command_monitor and result monitor


b) The following objects in the diagram are created by the new() function:
uvm_tlm_fifo


c) The following objects in the diagram are created by reference to the UVM factory:
random_tester_h, driver_h, coverage_h, scoreboard_h, command_monitor_h, result_monitor_h


d) Objects of the following classes retrieve BFM information from UVM by calling uvm_config_db:
command_monitor_h, driver_h, result_monitor_h


e) Objects of the following classes instantiate uvm_analysis_port:
command_monitor_h, result_monitor_h


f) Objects of the following classes instantiate uvm_get_port:
driver_h


g) Objects of the following classes instantiate uvm_put_port:
tpgen_h (random_tester_h)


h) The following uvm_*_port classes are parametrized:
uvm_analysis_port #(command_s) ap
uvm_analysis_port #(shortint) ap
uvm_get_port #(command_s) command_port
uvm_put_port #(command_s) command_port


i) The following classes include the implementation of the void write() method:
